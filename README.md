notes for my research

My reasech topic right now focus more on spatio-temporal action localization in the video.

Topics:

- [action recognition](https://github.com/wyhsirius/Research-wiki/wiki/action-papers)
- deep learning 
- GAN

I really hope writing notes here can help me understand more on these topics and share my ideas with those who are also interested.

Yaohui
