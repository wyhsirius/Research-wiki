# Research-wiki
This repository contains my reading list related to my research topic, I will also put my notes on that.

My reasech topic right now focus more on spatio-temporal action localization in the video.

Topics:

- [action localization]()
- action recognition
- deep learning 
- GAN

I really hope writing notes here can help me understand more on these topics and share my ideas with those who are also interested.
